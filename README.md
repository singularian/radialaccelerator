# Radial Accelerator
=======

A radial accelerator is a new type of particle accelerator. It consists of radial modules
interconnected to form a linear accelerator or ring accelerator. The radial modules 
are looped tracks that form a loop of a n dimensional width. The track size can be
anywhere from a micron or smaller to several centimenters or larger. Each module can be from several milimeters to up to a meter
or more in circumference depending on the design. They can be fabricated with chip lithography techniques or created by conventional techniques. 
It provides for a particle accelerator thousands of times larger than a simple ring or linear accelerator. A radial accelerator can be
a spiral or an array of interconnected channels.

The goal is to add some accelerator width and not just length.

An accelerator such as Fermilab could be as powerful as the SSC which cost multiple billions of dollars or the LHC.
Accelerators exceeding 1000 kilometers in length can be constructed.

Each radial module is interconnected to the next modual in sequence. Each particle is sent down the spiral from module to
radial module in sequence and exits to the next radial module.

Alternativelly, the modules can be composed of a network lattice or polymorphic 3-D volume of interconnected pathways. 

# Topology

Traditional particle accelerators can be grouped into the shape and topology. A radial accerator has several shapes of interconnected modules.

- Circular Radial Acceratorators
- Linear Radial Accelerators
- Vertical Radial Accelerators
- Radial Spiral Accelerators
- 2-D Grid Radial Accelerators
- 3-D Grid (composed of stacked 2-D Accelerator blocks)
- Star Radial Accelerators
- Coil Radial Accelerators 

# Cyclotrons

A cyclotron is much more complex and a radial spiral accelerator just uses a spiral track to accelerate the particle.

# Building the Radial Accelerator

Constructing the machine consists of creating interconnected radial modules. This is not a cyclotron. Cyclotron's suck.
Each particle enters the radial module and exits to the next module.

This is a diagram of a linear radial accelerator.

A linear radial accelerator contains an array or radial modules connected to form one accelerator. 
It consists of radial disc modules interconnected in series. A particle
enters one radial loop and exits to the next radial loop.

A circular radial accelerator looks a disc or rectangular module with linear tracks.  
The radial modules are interconnected in a circle or loop sequentially.

This is another diagram of a coil radial accelerator with linear track connected with arc bridges.
These can be interconnected 2-D or 3-Dimensionally to form accelerator array grids.

In this diagram a 2-D grid contains square particle accelerator modules. These contain coil accerators
which are linked together in series to form a 5 by 3 accelerator grid. The interconnects connect each of the
accelerator coils in series to an end row connector which connects the first row with the second and third row. A particle
accelerator grid sends the particle from row 1 to row 2 to row 3 from the input to the output in series between each module.

The 2-D accelerator grid can be any number n by n modules wide and can be interconnected to a 
duplicate accelerator grid to form a 3-D accelerator grid by utilizing a layer interconnect.

This is a diagram of a 2-D accerator grid with the grid module interconnects. 
It includes a layer interconnect to connect 2-D layers into a 3-D accelerator grid. In the diagram there are 9 types
of accelerator grid modules which consist of radial coil accelerator modules.

- (1) Particle Accelerator Injector
- (2) Input Module Connector
- (3) Top Right Edge Connectors
- (4) Bottom Right Edge Connectors
- (5) Top Left Edge Connectors
- (6) Bottom Left Edge Connectors
- (7) Coil Module with Connectors
- (8) Grid layer Interconnector
- (9) Output Connect (The exit point for the accelerated particle)

Inside this diagram is an example of a 3-D grid with multiple accelerator coils interconnected between
4 layers to form one grid.
